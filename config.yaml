          Welcome to my blog!


          I've been dabbling in game development as an hobby in the past couple of years.
          I built a point & click adventure game engine using [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) and made [two short games with it](https://apicici.itch.io),
          and I'm currently working on making a revised game engine from scratch in C++.


          I plan to use this blog as my "box of assorted cables and wires" (hence the name) where I write about various things that I learn how to do
          as I work on my engine and games, both as a way of remembering how they work when I inevitably forget and to share them with other people who may
          be trying to solve the same problems.
